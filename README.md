###Conclusion
Which hero is a better match with Sky Horse? Here are three conditions that could help you to find the right hero:
  1. the hero which is in your **core** team and must be 5 stars (?)
  2. the hero should be a DPS and is able to keep contributing damages after ultimate
  3. (if not satisfying 2, then...) the hero that has good survival ability which allows hero to survive and do damages till the end of the battle. (or even be able to turn the battle around after his/her HP is low)
